# Education
**GOAL**: Provide innovative frontier physics education and training
for undergraduate STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) majors, graduate students,
postdocs, and early career faculty as well as develop a diverse workforce in physics and engineering.

To accomplish the education goal above, PIRE-GEMADARC will meet the following
educational objectives: 
1. International experiences and workforce development: provide 174 students with international experiences and workforce development training to increase the number, quality and diversity of students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, who pursue careers in frontier science.

2. Leadership, collaboration, and communication skills: improve students' leadership, international
collaboration, and communication skills to be able to relate scientific knowledge to the broader
community, develop international collaborations and cultivate interactions between students and faculty
of different academic departments.

3. Collaboration capacity: strengthen collaboration ability to foster new scientists and young leaders in Ge detectors and technology resulting in new applications.

To achieve these objectives, PIRE-GEMADARC intends to:
* Create an integrated curriculum and advising program.
* Support international research projects.
* Implement an effective international study and learning.
* Recruit and retain graduate and undergraduate students under-represented in STEM as well as K-12.
* Develop early career researchers for leadership positions.
* Ensure effective international coordination and international travel logistics and protocols logistics.

### Internation Study and Learning for Students and K-12 Teachers
PIRE-GEMADARC will support global, experience-based international study at the Consortium's worldclass
facilities in China, Canada, Germany, and Taiwan. We emphasize a problem-based rather than the
more conventional discipline-oriented approach. This approach is designed to promote teamwork and
communication skills and ensure coherence and rigor in training. Graduate and undergraduate students
from 6 U.S. institutions (TTU, BHSU, UMN, UNC, TAMU, and USD) as well as K-12 teachers will be
simultaneously engaged in this international cooperative learning enterprise. Table 1 shows the number of
students and K-12 teachers to be trained annually.

### Plans for Early Career Faculty and Postdocs
PIRE-GEMADARC is committed to junior faculty development: Six (40%) of our domestic investigators
are early career. These include Kidd, Mount, Liu, Sander, Xu, and Wang. Among them, Xu is a first-year
new faculty hire. Liu, Mount, Sander, Xu, and Wang are task leaders and will report directly to PI Mei. In support of our institutions’ significant investment in research infrastructure to attract and
retain junior faculty, the goal of the Consortium's Junior Faculty Development Program is to successfully
promote the development and advancement of our early career faculty. 

Program aims are:
* Nurture and cultivate junior faculty to become the next generation of academic leaders.
* Retain homegrown faculty talent through concerted efforts to continuously build and expand professional skills. 

PIREGEMADARC will create a senior committee to provide career assistance to each faculty member. The
Committee, comprised of Mei, Wilkerson, Harris, Abt, Majorovits, Yue, and Wong, will work with each
early career investigator to improve their research and leadership skills. Finally, PIRE-GEMADARC's
“Postdoctoral Fellow to Faculty” transition program will provide a supportive mentored experience for
postdoctoral researchers in Physics at the participating institutions.
