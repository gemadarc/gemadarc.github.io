A bullet can distroy an apple, while a billiard ball can only strike another without tearing it apart. This difference is caused by the difference in the energies of the incident objects. A very energetic incident object tends to interact with only a small part of the target, while a less energetic one tends to interact with the target as a whole.

Similarly, a high energy neutrino, &nu;, tends to interact with individual nucleons in a nucleus, while a low energy &nu; can interact with a nucleus as a whole. The latter process is called the Coherent Elastic &nu;-Nucleus Scattering, or CEvNS in short.

The existence of CEvNS was predicted long time ago [1, 2],  but it was only observed very recently in the COHERENT experiment [3]. The CEvNS process is important in the evolution of astronomical objects [4]. It can also be used to probe non-standard neutrino interactions [5], sterile neutrinos [6] and nuclear structures [7, 8], as well as to monitor the activity of a reactor [9]. Many experiments along with COHERENT have been performed or proposed to detect CEvNS and to study neutrino physics beyond the Standard Model, for example, MINER [10], CONNIE [11], TEXONO [12], and RED [13], etc. The major difficulty is that the energies of recoiled nuclei are so small that detectors with extremely low energy thresholds are needed. PIRE collaborators are in the leading institutes of the MINER and TEXONO experiments.
